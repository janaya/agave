AGAVE - Affiliation Graphs Analysis and Visualisation Engine
===============


AGAVE reads a dataset based on the tripartite model of tagging
(Actors: users, authors, etc, Concepts: tags, keywords and Instances: 
instances, pictures, etc.), create broade/narrower relations between 
Concepts, generate graphs, analyse and provides and interface
to interactively visualise these graphs.

AGAVE implements the research approach exposed in the paper
"Enrichment of affiliation networks and information discovery in SKOS-based 
datasets" (available at
 http://www.inf.unibz.it/krdb/events/swap2010/paper-28.pdf)

AGAVE is designed to be reused as standalone modules or for other use
cases.

AGAVE is composed by the following modules:
 * pubmedxml2models: module to import XML Pubmed data about instances
 * fpggdb2models: module to import another database projects
 * ccbs_extractor: module to query SPARQL endpoint to extract broaders relations
 * zemanta_tags: module to extract concepts from projects with zemanta API  
 * graphanalysis: module to generate graph analyis and static graph images
 * json_graph: module to generate JSON graphs data to visualize interactively
 * module5: module to match projects tags with instances tags?
