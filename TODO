* all:
 [X] add multi db support (for projects and instances)
 [ ] it will have more sense to match the concepts from projects with authors in instances
 [ ] when graph recalculation is done or should be done when updating the database?

* tests:
 [ ] create tests for all!

* REST interface:
 [X] add authentication
 [X] add authentication for JSON graphs
 [ ] check that deleting removes m2m and related tables
 [ ] replace m2m urls?
 [X] in Concept POST or PUT update Broaders (and query Neurocommons?)
 [ ] add more documentation for API (the error codes and accepted JSON)

* JS enhancements:
 [ ] make graphs of same size
 [ ] make bigger nodes position closer to the center
 [ ] make edges stronger depending on weight
 [ ] make nodes clickable and show the new nodes?
 [ ] create slide and show less/more nodes depending on weight?

* Functionality
 [X] make better a-c
 [X] make c-c only with the author concepts
 [ ] parameter for number nodes?
 [ ] 5 AA different or all in one?
  * include aca?
  * include CC?
 [ ] button to save graph?

* FPGG Integration
 [X] graphs and json graphs need authentication?
  [X] API key?, same password as FPGG?, Done with HTTP Basic Authentication

* Evaluation: 
 [X] different form or over the nodes?, in FPGG...
 [ ] which questions?

* Refactorize code!!
 [] Decide app name and modules names
 [] Decide which version to use (agave. without dataset, crel with datasets)
 [] Create modules
   [] module to import data from XML
   [] module to extract broaders
   [] module to generate graph images (currently named graphs)
   [] module to generate statistics, metrics for the paper
   [] module to import instances
   [] module to visualize local graphs
 [X] Decide license (BSD, LGPL permits use as library in propietary software, MIT is not viric but is GPL compatible, GPLv3 would be ideal but not permited)
 [ ] eliminate redundant urls/views
 [ ] document code
 [ ] create pseudo CHANGELOG merging 3 repositories logs
 
* Future:
 [ ] Include/Change to manage all data in RDF?
 [ ] Include/Change to manage all data in Neo4j?
 [ ] Add support for rendering graphs with faces
 [ ] Add support for clicking in a node and expanding the local graph
